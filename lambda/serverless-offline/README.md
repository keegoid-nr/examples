# Instrumented Node.js Lambda

This is a "Hello, World" style Lambda function in Node.js, instrumented
with the New Relic Agent.

This example is both instructive, and a diagnostic tool: if you can
deploy this Lambda function, and see its events in NR One, you'll
know that all the telemetry plumbing is connected correctly.

## Building and deploying

### Prerequisites

- The [AWS CLI v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- The [AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
- [newrelic-lambda](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-cli#installation) CLI tool

Make sure you've run the `newrelic-lambda integrations install` command in your
AWS Region, and included the `--enable-license-key-secret` flag.

### deploy script

From a command prompt, in this directory, run

    ./deploy.sh <accountId> <region>

where `<accountId>` is your New Relic account ID, and  `<region>`
is your AWS Region, like "us-west-2".

This will package and deploy the CloudFormation stack for this example
function.

At this point, you can invoke the function. As provided, the example
function doesn't pay attention to its invocation event. If everything
has gone well, each invocation gets reported to New Relic, and its
telemetry appears in NR One.

## Code Structure

Now is also a good time to look at the structure of the example code.

### template.yaml

This function is deployed using a SAM template, which is a CloudFormation
template with some extra syntactic sugar for Lambda functions. In it, we
tell CloudFormation where to find lambda function code, what layers to use, and
what IAM policies to add to the Lambda function's execution role. We also set
environment variables that are available to the handler function.

### app.js

Lambda functions written in JavaScript are Node.js modules. The runtime loads them
just like any Node module, and then invokes the handler function for each
invocation event. New Relic publishes a Lambda Layer that wraps your handler
function, and initializes the New Relic agent, allowing us to collect telemetry.

There are a couple examples here of how you might add custom events and attributes
to the default telemetry.

Since JavaScript is a dynamic, interpreted language, the Agent can inject instrumentation
into the various client libraries you might be using in your function. This happens
once, during cold start, and provides rich, detailed instrumentation out of the box,
with minimal developer effort.
