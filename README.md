# Examples

This is a repository for examples, testing, and reproduction work. The focus is mostly AWS Lambda, but also some OpenTelemetry.

## Lambda Deployment methods

- [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/)
- [AWS SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/)
- [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/framework) with [serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers](https://github.com/newrelic/serverless-newrelic-lambda-layers)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)

## Lambda Runtimes

- Node.js
- Python
- Go

## Otel

- Test payloads that are too large by generating a lot of dummy data.
